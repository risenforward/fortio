    h3 Authentication

  .panel-body
    p To use private API, you need to get your access/secret key first. After signed up on peatio.com, send a mail to <a href='mailto:community@peatio.com'>community@peatio.com</a> to request for access/secret key pair.
    p All private API requires 3 authentication parameters and zero or more API specific parameters. The 3 authentication parameters are:
    table.table
      tr
        td access_key
        td Your access key.
      tr
        td tonce
        td tonce is a timestamp in integer, stands for milliseconds elapsed since <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_epoch'>Unix epoch</a>. Each request must have a tonce greater than previous one.
      tr
        td signature
        td Signature of the API request, generated by you, use your secret key.

    p Signature is a hash of the request (in canonical string form):
    pre
      | hash = HMAC-SHA256(payload, secret_key).to_hex

    p Payload is a combination of HTTP verb, uri, and query string:
    pre
      | def payload
          # canonical_verb is HTTP verb like GET/POST in upcase.
          # canonical_uri is request path like /api/v2/markets.
          # canonical_query is the request query sort in alphabetica order, e.g. a=1&b=2&c=3
          # The combined string looks like: GET|/api/v2/markets|a=1&b=2&c=3
          "\#{canonical_verb}|\#{canonical_uri}|\#{canonical_query}"
        end
