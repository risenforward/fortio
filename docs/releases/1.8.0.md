## Peatio 1.8.0 (May 3, 2018) ##

### Overview ###

  This release is focused on:
  
  1. Support for ERC20 tokens.
  
  2. Fixing issues at all available APIs: Events API, Management API v2 & Member API v2.
  
  3. Improvements for transaction processing mechanisms.
  
  4. Fixing UI issues.
  
  The release doesn't provide lot of new feature, instead it is focused on stabilization of current codebase.
  
### Breaking changes ###

* [#913](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/913): All wallet addresses, transaction IDs, TIDs, RIDs are now case sensitive.

  The next migration files are must-learn before doing any upgrades:
  
  * https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/913/files#diff-685a1e4a0464f3358e0aaba59188992c
  
  * https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/913/files#diff-4d9437ddbba478de18ee9a1d044f3be0

  Please, also be sure to checkout the new variable for currencies: `case_sensitive`. This variable determines if wallet addresses and transaction IDs are case sensitive or insensitive. Be sure to set the correct value for your currencies.

* [#1037](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/1037): Replace state to action in withdraws and change behaviour of initial withdraw state (Management API v1).

  Changes to **`POST /management_api/v1/withdraws/new`**

  Now the behaviours for fiat and crypto withdraws are different.
  
  *Fiat*: money are immediately locked, withdraw state is set to «submitted», system workers will validate withdraw later against suspected activity, and assign state to «rejected» or «accepted». The processing will not begin automatically. The processing may be initiated manually from admin panel or by PUT /management_api/v1/withdraws/action.
  
  *Coin*: money are immediately locked, withdraw state is set to «submitted», system workers will validate withdraw later against suspected activity, validate withdraw address and set state to «rejected» or «accepted». Then in case state is «accepted» withdraw workers will perform interactions with blockchain. The withdraw receives new state «processing». Then withdraw receives state either «succeed» or «failed».

  The parameter `state` replaced with `action`. The available values include:
  
  * `process`: system will lock the money, check for suspected activity, validate recipient address, and initiate the processing of the withdraw. The fiat withdraws will be completed immediately while crypto withdraws will be processed by workers since they require interaction with blockchain.
  
  Migration steps:
  
  * If you depend on `state: :prepared` you will need to review the logic of your app because it is now not possible to create withdraw with no money locked.

  * If you depend on `state: :submitted` you can safely remove this parameter from payload. 
  
  Changes to **`PUT /management_api/v1/withdraws/state`**

  This route changed to `PUT /management_api/v1/withdraws/action`.

  The parameter `state` replaced with `action`. The available values include:
  
  * `process`: system will lock the money, check for suspected activity, validate recipient address, and initiate the processing of the withdraw. The fiat withdraws will be completed immediately while crypto withdraws will be processed by workers since they require interaction with blockchain.

  * `cancel`: system will mark withdraw as «canceled», and unlock the money (if they were locked).

  Migration steps:
  
  * `state: :submitted` is no longer supported in this call. If you want to initiate the processing of withdraw pass `action: :process`.
  
  * If you depend on `state: :canceled` replace it with `action: :cancel`. 

### New features ###

* [#913](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/913): Add support for ERC20 tokens.

  The patch adds support for ERC20 tokens.
  
  Read more about how to use this feature at:
  
  * config/seed/currencies.yml.erb (find currency `TRST`).
  
  * docs/peatio/erc20.md
  
  * docs/peatio/testnet/erc20.md
  
* [#980](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/980): Ability to establish cookie-based session using API.

  The patch adds new Member API v2 call `POST /api/v2/sessions` which allows to establish classical cookie-based session which expires along with JWT expiration time. It may be useful when Peatio is used as backend for SPA frontend along with existing Trading UI (which is cookie-based).

  It is now possible to set fiat deposit fee (fixed size only).

* [#935](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/935): Ability to get deposit, withdraw and trading fees using Member API v2.

  The patch adds public calls: `GET /api/v2/fees/deposit`, `GET /api/v2/fees/withdraw`, `GET /api/v2/fees/trading`.

* [#1033](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/1033): Expose account balance via Management API v1.

  The patch adds new Management API v1 calls: `POST /management_api/v1/accounts/balance`.
