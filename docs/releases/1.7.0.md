### Breaking changes ###

* [#800](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/800): Remove «WithdrawDestination» model in favor of RID (recipient ID).

  The patch makes Peatio free out of all bank credentials, bank accounts and other stuff. People should think about Peatio like microservice for wallet management and trading. Applications which use Peatio for these kind of tasks are now able to link withdraw on Peatio to their's own using field called `rid` (recipient ID). This field is required and must uniquely identify bank account (for cryptocurrency withdraws it must identity wallet address in blockchain).

  The changes to API:
  
  * `GET /api/v2/withdraws/destinations`, `POST /api/v2/withdraws/destinations`: API calls removed.
  
  * Request formats of `GET /api/v2/withdraws`, `POST /api/v2/withdraws`: parameter `destination_id` replaced with `rid`.

  * Response formats of `GET /api/v2/withdraws`, `POST /api/v2/withdraws`: `txid` is not exposed as `blockhain_txid`, `destination` replaced with `rid`.

  * Request formats of `POST /management_api/v1/withdraws/new`: parameter `destination_id` was removed.

  IMPORTANT: The patch drops table `withdraw_destinations`. Be sure to backup the data before running migrations. The migration will automatically calculate field `rid` from `Withdraw#bank_account_number` (for fiat withdraws) and `Withdraw#address` (for crypto).
  
  Also fixes: #799, #772.
  
  The patch merged to 1.6 and up.
  
* [#820](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/820): Remove `Deposit#fund_extra`, `Deposit#fund_uid` and usages.

  The patch removes useless fields from deposit: `fund_extra`, `fund_uid`. Be sure to backup your data in case you need these fields.
  
* [#816](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/816): Remove `Withdraw#sn` and all usages.

  The patch removed useless withdraw model fields: `sn`. Be sure to backup this field in case you need the values.
  
* [#829](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/829): Replace `PaymentTransaction` in favor of `Deposit`.  
  
  The patch drops `PaymentTransaction` model in favor of `Deposit` which simplifies the code a lot.
  
  We also improved database indices for deposits.
  
  The breaking changes include:
  
  * Response format of `GET /api/v2/deposits`, `GET /api/v2/deposit`: `done_at` is now exposed as `completed_at`.

  * Response format of `POST /management_api/v1/deposits`, `POST /management_api/v1/deposits/get`, `POST /management_api/v1/deposits/new`, `PUT /management_api/v1/deposits/state`: added `blockchain_confirmations` to response.
  
* [#850](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/850): Remove mailing stuff from Peatio.

  The patch removes mailers, views, gems, variables and documentation related to mailing. Now Peatio will not send any emails. It means you will need to implement your own mailing system using upcoming Peatio Events API. For example, you can send mail «Your deposit successfully accepted» when your application received event from Peatio (via AMQP) and deposit payload has status «accepted». This is very flexible way of extending Peatio with any amount of functionality. If you really need mails stay on 1.6.
  
* [#881](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/881): Embed «DepositChannel» in «Currency».

  The patch migrates `config/deposit_channels.yml` to database layer.
  
  The migration steps include:
  
  1. Rename `config/deposit_channels.yml` to `config/deposit_channels.old.yml`.
  
  2. Execute `bundle exec rake db:migrate`.

  The patch adds `Currency#deposit_confirmations` which defines how many confirmations in blockchain transaction must receive to be accepted on Peatio.

* [#884](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio/pull/884): Embed «WithdrawChannel» in «Currency».

  The patch migrates `config/withdraw_channels.yml` to database layer.

  1. Rename `config/withdraw_channels.yml` to `config/withdraw_channels.old.yml`.
  
  2. Execute `bundle exec rake db:migrate`.
  
  The patch adds `Currency#withdraw_fee` which defined fixed fee for withdraw.
